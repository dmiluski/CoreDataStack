#  Core Data


## Negatives

- Why can't I see ManagedObjectModel property names? Able to see in model, but it is not easy to get to without opening the model file.
- Current approach to double save in child context is problematic. Assumes parent is main. Instead, offer a method outside of the view that observes/saves change.
